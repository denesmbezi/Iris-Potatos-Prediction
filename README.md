######### Iris Potato Project #########
Project Overview
The Iris Potato Project is a machine learning classification project aimed at predicting the species of iris flowers or categorizing types of potatoes based on various features. Using datasets like the famous Iris dataset or a potato classification dataset, the project demonstrates how machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, can be applied to solve classification problems.

############# Key Features ###########
Data Exploration: The dataset contains various features like petal length, petal width, and sepal measurements (for the Iris dataset) or similar features for potatoes.
Model Training: We use classification models such as Logistic Regression to predict the species of iris flowers or classify potatoes based on the input features.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to ensure the model generalizes well.
############ How It Works #####################
Data Preprocessing: The data is loaded, cleaned, and features are selected for the model.
Model Training: We split the data into training and test sets. A classification model (Logistic Regression) is trained on the training set.
Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the test set, and performance metrics are calculated.
######### Technologies Used ###################
Python: The core programming language.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Seaborn/Matplotlib: For data visualization and model evaluation.
